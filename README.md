## Modify the Page
The method of changing page is using hash in the url, therefore there is needless to reload the website when switch the page.

The kernel of the front-site operation is in the `templates/index.html`, the only place user need to modify is style.

If you want to create a new page, you can create a new file named `page-<index>.html` in the `pages` directory. Remember that the index must follow the order starting from 1 or it will not be loaded. If you want to switch to another page which not the sibling of the page, you can easily done it by change the url hash to the `page-<index>` py run the javascript: `windows.hash = "page-<index>";`.

To embed an markdown file into the page, you can use the `zero-md` tag like `<zero-md src="/markdowns/README.md"><zero-md>`(there is an example in `pages/page-2.html`). The files under the `markdowns` directory will map to the route `/markdown` as `static` to `/static`.
